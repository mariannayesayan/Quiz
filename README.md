Queue has a first in first out (FIFO) principle, which means that you have agroup of objects, where you can insert and remove items. So, queue works in the following way: when you insert some object you have to remove it firstly. And in Queue we have only 2 operations : Enqueue(inset) and Dequeue(remove). The complexity of Queue is always O(1).
A good example of queue will be when you take a ticket and wait for your turn. So, as soon as you get the ticket you can enturn. Here, again works First in first out principle.
